# LINREG

This package was created for the BIOSTAT 625 course at the University of Michigan. It contains the linreg() function which fits a linear regression model to a dataset in R. The goal is to match the output of the already existing lm() function in R. 

## Background on Linear Regression

In the field of statistics, linear regression is a way to model the relationship between an outcome and one or more response variables. If there are more than one response variables, we call this multiple linear regression. This form of analysis predicts the value of the outcome (dependent variable) based on the response (independent variable).
